## FAQ

### Is there a maximum ammount of videos for downloading a playlist?

- Short answer? No... Long answer? It's complicated, while the app itself doesn't have a limit, downloading a 1000 video playlist, for exaple, will take a long time, since the app as to "fetch" information on the video , so even before starting the download it will take a long time, if you dont mind waiting there should be no problem in downloading large playlists.
